#getting a new website up!

# Introduction #

I plan on pushing out a better website than the current one, however I am no web designer. I can implement the HTML and whatnot, but without no design to go by; no colour scheme I'm pretty lost.

There's not too much to the site really - just need some screenshots, program information, possibly include the help pages, project news and some other stuff.

I kind of have a design in mind, similar to all the usual web 2.0 stuffs but not too sure about a colour scheme. I also lack graphics which makes it a bit trickier.
