# Fetching the code #

Whyteboard uses the [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com) version control system to publish code updates.

You can fetch the latest development code, help files and translations by first installing Bazaar (see the link above for details), and by executing this command at the command line:

`bzr branch lp:whyteboard`

Windows users using Bazaar explorer can check out the code using the GUI and using `lp:whyteboard` as the branch location.



# Browse the code #

[Look at the code here](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~sproaty/whyteboard/development/files) - the source code is under `/whyteboard`. There may be some 'fluff' in the project's directory for IDE preferences etc
