#Proposal for PDF zooming

= Introduction =

When a PDF is loaded into Whyteboard, its text can be a bit small and hard to read. This proposal talks about a solution.

= Details =

This issue can be solved by calling ImageMagick's convert function with extra processing options to increase the zoom and detail density; this has the side-effect of taking much longer to process the conversion, compared to "standard".

This would create a higher quality PNG file, which would be able to be zoomed in on using wxPython's image functions. 

The alternative would be to convert as normal, but call convert when the user zooms in. This has some bad side-effects, however:

  * User zooms in once: convert is called, screen redraws
  * User zooms in again, convert called again, screen redrawn
  * user zooms out, convert called...

etc etc. Perhaps the best idea would be to create a higher quality PNG file in the first pace.

As it is, a PDF is converted once per PDF saved into a Whyteboard file, when the .wtbd file is loaded the temporary PNG files from the conversion are restored.

By creating higher quality temporary PNGs in the first place, I can probably add in image zooming using wxPython's API which should perform much better than repeatedly calling IM's convert.
